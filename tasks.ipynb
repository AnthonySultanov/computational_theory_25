Many difficult processes in cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 are built on functions like rotl, rotr, ch, and maj. Gaining knowledge about how these operations change individual bits provides important insight into the safe and effective processing of data. In addition to reproducing behavior found in lower level languages like C, by putting these primitives into practice and testing them in Python, we also create a strong foundation for investigating and utilizing cryptographic algorithms and digital security measures in contemporary applications."

This distribution is further improved by the final modulo operation with another prime number (101). Through this task, we learn about the fundamental design principles of hashing and how mathematical decisions, such as prime numbers, contribute to the creation of efficient and successful hash functions.

Padding is a very important preprocessing step in SHA-256 that ensures the message length meets specific structural requirements. Before hashing, messages must be padded so their length in bits is congruent to 448 modulo 512, allowing room for a final 64 bit length encoding. This task we go through on how to create a Python function that implements SHA 256 style padding for any given input file.  The appropriate padding is then added using bitwise logic and byte manipulation techniques. This includes a sequence of zero bits, a single 1-bit represented as 0x80, and the original message length encoded as a 64-bit big-endian integer. Gaining knowledge of this procedure helps one to understand how hash algorithms such as SHA-256 preserve security and structural integrity while transforming data.\n"

    "- The **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, on the other hand, was much faster and more efficient for generating a large list of primes. By marking multiples of known primes in a boolean list, it avoided redundant calculations and scaled much better with higher limits.\n",
